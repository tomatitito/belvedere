Dashboard view showing Town/Rigs hierarchy\n2. Agent status visualization (Mayor, Polecats, Witness, Refinery)\n3. Convoy progress tracking and management\n4. Hook state visualization (git worktrees, work persistence)\n5. Real-time updates of agent activity\n6. Configuration management interface\n7. Beads/issue tracking integration\n8. Mail system visualization\n\nTECHNICAL APPROACH:\n1. Which Zed components to keep (GPUI, rendering, state management)\n2. Which to remove (editor-specific: buffers, language servers, etc.)\n3. New components needed for Gas Town visualization\n4. Data model transformations (editor state → agent/convoy state)\n5. API integration with Gas Town backend (Go services)\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n- How to structure the new UI codebase\n- Data flow between Gas Town (Go) and UI (Rust/GPUI)\n- Real-time updates mechanism\n- State synchronization strategy\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PHASES:\nBreak down into logical phases with dependencies\n\nREFERENCE MATERIALS:\n- Gas Town README: https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/blob/main/README.md\n- Zed uses GPUI framework with 211 crates\n- Gas Town has dashboard mentioned in README (line 362-378)\n\nDeliver a detailed markdown plan document.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-13T15:44:57.011369109Z","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-13T15:44:57.011369109Z"}
