(Visual alternative to CLI, better UX for managing rigs/agents/convoys)\n   - Architecture (Rust/GPUI, hybrid CLI → full Rust transition)\n\n2. **Features**\n   - Rig panel (navigate/manage rigs)\n   - Mayor interaction panel (chat with Mayor)\n   - Convoy tracking (visualize work progress)\n   - Agent monitoring (polecats, witness, refinery)\n   - Real-time updates\n\n3. **Installation**\n   - Prerequisites (Rust 1.70+, Git, Gas Town CLI)\n   - Build from source:\n     ```bash\n     git clone \u003crepo\u003e\n     cd gazetown  # or whatever we rename it\n     cargo build --release\n     ./target/release/gastown\n     ```\n   - Platform-specific notes (macOS/Linux/Windows)\n\n4. **Usage**\n   - Quick start guide\n   - How to connect to your Gas Town workspace\n   - Basic workflows (view rigs, talk to Mayor, track convoys)\n   - Keyboard shortcuts\n   - Configuration\n\n5. **Development**\n   - Project structure (crate overview)\n   - Building (cargo build)\n   - Running (cargo run)\n   - Testing (cargo test)\n   - Contributing guidelines\n\n6. **Architecture**\n   - GPUI framework explanation\n   - Reused Zed components (git crate, ui widgets)\n   - Gas Town integration (CLI wrapper → Rust library)\n   - Data flow diagram\n\n7. **Roadmap**\n   - Current: PoC with CLI wrapper\n   - Phase 2: Full Rust backend\n   - Future: Advanced features\n\n8. **License**\n   - Update from Zed's licenses (GPL-3.0)\n   - Attribution to Zed project\n\n9. **Acknowledgments**\n   - Zed editor team\n   - Gas Town project\n   - GPUI framework\n\nFORMAT: Clear, concise, with code examples and screenshots where helpful\n\nDELIVERABLE: README.md that makes sense for first-time users","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mayor@gastown.local","created_at":"2026-01-13T22:01:57.496807471Z","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-13T22:01:57.496807471Z"}
