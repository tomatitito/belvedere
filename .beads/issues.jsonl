{"id":"gazetown-2fh","title":"Establish upstream sync strategy with Zed repository","description":"We need a strategy to keep Gazetown in sync with upstream Zed changes, particularly for shared code we depend on (GPUI, core crates).\n\n## Problem\n\nGazetown is a fork of Zed. When upstream Zed makes breaking changes (like the GPUI refactor in 6fca1d2b0b), our code breaks. We discovered this when gastown failed to compile due to ViewContext/WindowContext removal.\n\n## Questions to Answer\n\n1. Which crates do we actually use/modify vs. just inherit?\n2. How often should we sync with upstream?\n3. Should we track upstream as a git remote and periodically merge/rebase?\n4. How do we handle conflicts in crates we've modified?\n\n## Possible Approaches\n\n1. **Periodic merge**: Add zed/zed as upstream remote, merge main periodically\n2. **Cherry-pick**: Only pull specific commits/features we need\n3. **Diverge fully**: Accept we're a fork and handle API changes manually\n4. **Subtree/submodule**: Extract shared crates as separate dependencies\n\n## Considerations\n\n- We have local modifications to CI workflows (xtask)\n- gastown is our custom crate that uses GPUI\n- Most other crates are unmodified from Zed","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Document which crates we modify vs. use as-is\n- [ ] Choose and document sync strategy\n- [ ] Set up upstream remote if using merge approach\n- [ ] Create runbook for handling upstream syncs","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jens.kouros@posteo.de","created_at":"2026-01-14T22:32:06.091977+01:00","created_by":"Jens Kouros","updated_at":"2026-01-14T22:32:06.091977+01:00","labels":["documentation","infrastructure","upstream"]}
