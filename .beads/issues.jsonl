{"id":"gazetown-tpu","title":"Support Danger CI for fork PRs using a Personal Access Token","description":"## Context\n\nThe Danger workflow currently uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication. This works for PRs from the same repository but **won't work for PRs from forks** since `GITHUB_TOKEN` has restricted write permissions on fork PRs.\n\n## Task\n\nTo support external contributors submitting PRs from forks:\n\n1. Create a fine-grained GitHub PAT with `Pull requests: Read and write` permission scoped to this repository\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`\n3. Update `tooling/xtask/src/tasks/workflows/danger.rs` to use `secrets.DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`\n4. Regenerate workflows with `cargo xtask workflows`\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub fine-grained PATs](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)\n- [Repository secrets](https://github.com/tomatitito/Gazetown/settings/secrets/actions)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jens.kouros@posteo.de","created_at":"2026-01-14T19:23:25.390825+01:00","created_by":"Jens Kouros","updated_at":"2026-01-14T19:23:25.390825+01:00"}
